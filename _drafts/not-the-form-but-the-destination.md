## It's not the form but the destination

This is a written version of a presentation I gave at mmdp. Over the past year we have worked to add permission and issue reporting modules to our digital collections platform. The actual form creation process (where many ppl spend their effort) was not the hardest part though. It was what to do with the info. Many people might say well just send it to an email inbox. Well here's the issue: our normal response is to use our generic webmaster account which has multiple people in different areas monitoring it and contains 10s of thousands of emails. We were afraid they would be lost. We spent a lot time thinking about where things need to go and what form would ensure the best response. For permission requests, they need to go to one of 2 places, the university archives or the digital collections team (us). The best place for the archives was an email address that the archives aaa good at monitoring. It actually goes to a ticketing system. D.C.? The other form concerned issues reported by users. Wanted to go to a lace that encourages us to immediately fix the issue.
